                <p>I think my parents are pretty cool.I love them a lot, and I mean it. They always do what they can to make sure we 
                    ,the kids, can succeed in life. Even when we are in a tough spot they still are trying their best.
                    They always tell us <strong>My job as a parent is to make you better than me</strong>.

                    My favorite outting with my family, was when we wnt to Six Flags. It was really fun, but the riders were either not fun 
                    at all or extreme. Actually most of them to me were boring, except for X2, never riding that again. We rode all of the 
                    rollercoasters, except for Superman. Since those rides to me where boring, they said next time we will go to Cedar Point.
