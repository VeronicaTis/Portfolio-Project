            <h1>My name is Veronica Tisdel!</h1>
            <p>I am 16 years,and my birthday is November 23, 2003. I am currently
                in highschool and West-Mec. I attend Deer Valley High School and am on the college prep track.
                However, at West-Mec I am studying coding, which it is very fun.
                When I get older I plan to be a Biomedical Eingeneer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to eat pure sugar. Plain chocolate is gross, but pixie stix are great.
                I like to not cook, the only thing I prefer to do in the kitchen is eat. However, I have to
                clean it too. There are times where I do cook, my favorite thing to make is cereal. I like to play
                video games with my online friends. I also like to read pysical books and 
                online comics. I love music a lot, so much so I play the clarinet, and currently learning how to play the piano (maybe bass violin to).
                Music is so good to me I just think I want to play it to, so picked up an instrument.
                Then I discovered Marching Band, where I can play music and march at the same time.
                I have met a lot of new people, thanks to marching Band, who have became my friends. I like to hang
                out with friends often.
